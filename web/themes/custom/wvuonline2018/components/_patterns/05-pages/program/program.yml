        "Students who prefer a low-residency approach, online learning with required on-campus residencies, can elect to follow the traditional path in Comprehensive Sport Industry Management. The low-residency format offers the flexibility to complete courses at times that are convenient for students. Students will complete 75 percent of the coursework online and the remaining 25 percent will be completed onsite at the WVU campus over a two-week period during the first semester (summer). Throughout the summer on-campus format, students will network and interact with their cohort and faculty. To enhance their careers, students must expand their skill sets including event management, administration and governance, staffing, marketing and resource development. The low-residency program also consists of 10 courses, but is a summer only start."

      'Dr. Bulger was very involved in sports at a young age and throughout his childhood and adolescence. As a young boy in Buffalo, NY, he played almost every traditional team sport there was. Baseball, basketball and soccer–just to name a few–slowly transitioned into cross country and track as he began his college career. When choosing a field of study in college as an undergraduate and master’s student, his decision never wavered. It would be physical education.'
