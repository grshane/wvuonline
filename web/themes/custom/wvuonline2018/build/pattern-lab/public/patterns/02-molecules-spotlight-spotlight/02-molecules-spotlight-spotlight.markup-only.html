      Dr. Bulger was very involved in sports at a young age and throughout his childhood and adolescence. As a young boy in Buffalo, NY, he played almost every traditional team sport there was. Baseball, basketball and soccer–just to name a few–slowly transitioned into cross country and track as he began his college career. When choosing a field of study in college as an undergraduate and master’s student, his decision never wavered. It would be physical education.
